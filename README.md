**Note:** Temporarily change-frozen, building a new app that implements similar functionality for Radarr, Sonarr, etc, using Trakt and IMDB lists or *arr tags. Will be implemented with a web interface from the start, so is naturally taking a bit more time. [New app repo is here](https://github.com/cmathews393/plex-playlist-manager).

## How To

### Prerequisites

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed (if not running docker)
2. Ensure you have poetry installed

### Setup (Script Version)

1. Clone the repo.
2. Configure settings for your environment:
   - Get Plex API key.
   - Get Spotify ID and API key.
   - Get Lidarr API key.
3. Run with poetry (`cd spotiplex && poetry install`, `poetry run python main.py`)
4. Follow CLI prompts

### Setup (Docker Version)

Note: Tested only on Linux, Docker version 24.0.5. Other environments are "unsupported", but issues can be reported.

1. `docker pull 0xchloe/spotiplex:latest`
2. `touch spotiplex.env`
3. Copy the contents of `default.env` from this repo to your new `.env` file, and edit as needed.
4. `docker run --env-file spotiplex.env 0xchloe/spotiplex`
5. Re-start the container to re-sync. Manual playlist syncing can be accomplished by including manual playlists in the .env file

## Dependencies

Using [python-plexapi](https://github.com/pkkid/python-plexapi), [spotipy](https://github.com/spotipy-dev/spotipy), [rtoml](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/rtoml) , [schedule](https://github.com/dbader/schedule)

## Upcoming Planned Features

- Add to Plex-Playlist-Manager (See above)
- Add fuzzy search to Plex
- Troubleshoot Spotify API issues (see below)

## Known Issues

1. Some Spotify Playlists, especially auto-generated and non-public ones, may not be accessible via API, resulting in 404 errors.
2. Occasional track errors in certain playlists. The script will continue and import the rest of the playlist, noting any issues.
